Project: Live Text Speech

### Project Description: 

  >The user's live audio will be recorded and transcribed to text sentence by sentence. Phrases are sequentially displayed to the screen, bottom up.
  >
  >The primary use case we focused on is for hard of hearing individuals playing video games. 
  >For some video games, like Valorant, communication is a very important aspect of the gameplay--an aspect which is of course less accessible to hard of hearing individuals.
  >We wanted to allow hard of hearing individuals the opportunity to play tactical, communication-based games without being at an unnecessary disadvantage.
  >
  >Though we focussed on one use case, this technology can be used for a variety of situations.
  >If a user is in a call, for example, this technology will allow hard of hearing individuals to have a better experience and be more confident about what others are saying. This could also be used for individuals taking online courses to better hear their instructors. It could similarly be used for individuals who are taking job training online. Broadly, anything involving online audio communication can make use of technology like this to make life easier for many.
